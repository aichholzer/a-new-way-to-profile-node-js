# A new way to profile Node.js 

## Abstract

It's been weeks and the organization you work for seems to be slowly turning against you. 
At least that's what it feels like. User experience is poor because of slow API's, 
sales are being missed, performance-linked SEO heuristics are causing a drop in 
page ranking. Mobile users have all but given up. Operations have reported that 
a critical Node.js service owned by your team is spinning at 70-100% CPU, and all 
parts of the application dependent on the service are experiencing intermittent
slowdowns or in some cases, complete unavailability. What are you going to do now?
In this talk we'll present a new and straightforward way to identify bottlenecks
in Node.js and beyond.
